=head1 NAME

Devel::LineTrace - Apply traces to individual lines.

=head1 SYNPOSIS

    perl -d:LineTrace myscript.pl [args ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a class that enables assigning Perl code callbacks to certain
lines in the original code B<without modifying it>. 

To do so prepare a file with the following syntax:

    [source_filename]:[line]
        [CODE]
        [CODE]
        [CODE]
    [source_filename]:[line]
        [CODE]
        [CODE]
        [CODE]

Which will assign the [CODE] blocks to the filename and line combinations.
The [CODE] sections are indented from the main blocks. To temporarily cancel
a callback put a pound-sign (#) right at the start of the line (without 
whitespace beforehand).

The location of the file should be specified by the PERL5DB_LT environment 
variable (or else it defaults to C<perl-line-traces.txt>.)

Then invoke the perl interpreter like this:
   
    perl -d:LineTrace myprogram.pl
